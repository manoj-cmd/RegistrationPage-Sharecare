Sharecare Registration Page Replication
This project is a replication of the registration page from Sharecare (https://try.sharecare.com/register). The form simulates submitting data to a /register endpoint. The focus is on creating a responsive layout, form validation, and closely matching the original UI using CSS. Unit tests are also included to ensure the functionality of the components.

Additional Notes

Using Next.js is optional but can help with routing and server-side rendering if needed.
